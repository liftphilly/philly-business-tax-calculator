FORMULAS

TAX LIABILITY FORMULAS:
Taxable Gross Receipts,"= MAX(0, Gross Receipts - Exemption)"

Taxable Net Income (BIRT),"= MAX(0, Net Income - Statutory Deduction)"
Taxable Net Income (NPT),"= Net Income (full amount, no exemption)"

BIRT (Gross Receipts),= Taxable GR × BIRT GR Rate
BIRT (Net Income),= Taxable NI (BIRT) × BIRT NI Rate
Total BIRT,= BIRT (GR) + BIRT (NI)

NPT (before credit),= Taxable NI (NPT) × NPT Rate
BIRT Credit,= BIRT (Net Income) × 60%
NPT (after credit),"= MAX(0, NPT (before credit) - BIRT Credit)"

Total Tax Liability,= Total BIRT + NPT (after credit)

Est. BIRT,= Prior Year BIRT × 100% (unless grace year)
Est. NPT,= Prior Year NPT (after credit) × 50%
Prior Year Adjustment,= -(Est. BIRT + Est. NPT paid in prior filing)
Total Cash Outlay,= Tax Due + Est. BIRT + Est. NPT + Adjustment
